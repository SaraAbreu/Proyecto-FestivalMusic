# Proyecto-FestivalMusic
This project consists of a website aimed at promoting a music festival. The site is designed to provide detailed information about the event, participating artists, location, ticket purchase and other important details. Users can explore the timeline of the performances, view the list of artists, and find all relevant information about the event.
